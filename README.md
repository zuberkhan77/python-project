# Simple Calculator Using Tkinter

This project is a graphical calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports decimal input and provides a clear function to reset the current input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Decimal Support**: Input and calculate using decimal numbers.
- **Clear Functionality**: Easily clear the input field for new calculations.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

## How It Works

### Buttons:
- **Numbers (0-9)**: Input numeric values.
- **Operators (+, -, *, /)**: Perform arithmetic operations.
- **Decimal (.)**: Input decimal values.
- **Equal (=)**: Calculate the result of the entered expression.
- **Clear**: Clear the current input to start fresh.

### Example Usage:
1. Enter `7`.
2. Press `+`.
3. Enter `3`.
4. Press `=`.

The result `10` will be displayed in the input field.

## File Structure

- `calculator.py`: Contains the Python code for the calculator program.

## Customization

You can enhance and modify this calculator to suit your needs:
- **Colors**: Adjust the `bg` (background color) and `fg` (foreground/text color) properties to change the appearance.
- **Button Sizes**: Modify the `height` and `width` properties of buttons for larger or smaller buttons.
- **Additional Functions**: Add more features, such as:
  - Advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, powers, trigonometric functions).
  - Memory functions (e.g., `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, `MC`).

## Potential Enhancements

- Add a **memory function** (e.g., `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, `MC`).
- Include a **scientific mode** with advanced operations.
- Improve error handling (e.g., for division by zero or invalid inputs).

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the `calculator.py` file using the command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
